                    The <span>Higher</span> Manifesto
                </h2>
                <div className="manifesto-content">
                    <p>
                        <span className="highlight">Higher</span> is not just a word—it's a way of life. It's the unshakeable belief that no matter where we are, there's always further to go. In a world full of doubt, negativity, and people telling you to "be realistic," Higher stands as a rebellion. A rejection of limits. A refusal to accept that this is as good as it gets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are the ones who looked at the charts when they said it was over—and we held. We are the ones who watched the FUD spread like wildfire—and we didn't flinch. We are the ones who understood something the doubters never will: <span className="highlight">the ceiling doesn't exist</span>. It never did. Every "top" was just a stepping stone. Every crash was just a reset before the next ascent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Higher is not a promise of riches. It's not financial advice. It's something deeper. It's the philosophy that drives the diamond hands. The mindset that separates the believers from the paper-handed masses. When you're Higher, you don't look down. You don't check the charts every five minutes in fear. You check them in curiosity, because you already know where this is going.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This community was built by people who refused to settle. Traders who became holders. Speculators who became believers. We didn't come here for a quick flip. We came here because we recognized something special—a movement that speaks to the very core of what we want: <span className="highlight">more</span>. More freedom. More conviction. More defiance against those who said we couldn't.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Higher is the answer to every question. "When do we sell?" <span className="highlight">Higher.</span> "What's the target?" <span className="highlight">Higher.</span> "How far can this go?" <span className="highlight">Higher.</span> It's not a meme. It's not copium. It's the truth we've all felt in our bones since the moment we understood what this was really about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So welcome. Whether you just arrived or you've been here since day one, you're part of something bigger now. A collective of dreamers, builders, and unbreakable believers. There is no exit strategy here. There is no "taking profits." There is only the path forward. And that path? It only goes one direction.
                    </p>
